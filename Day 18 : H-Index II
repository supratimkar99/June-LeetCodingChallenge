//Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
//write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
//According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each,
//and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

//If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
