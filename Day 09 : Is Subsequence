//Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.
//A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters
//without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
//(ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
